He specialises in modelling and simulating renewable energy systems, with a particular interest in detailed representation of complex distribution multi vector energy systems and their analysis. My studies will further investigate the impact of distribution level interactions on transmission network operating decisions, given specific scenarios such as high penetration of distributed generation, renewables and decarbonising of heat.<\/p>\n<div class=\"people-text\">\n<p>This work will be directly included in the development of the energy supply model under MISTRAL.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cardiff University<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":38593,"template":"","categories":[64],"areas":[41],"class_list":["post-34265","person","type-person","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-researchers","areas-energy"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/person\/34265","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/person"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/person"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/38593"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34265"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34265"},{"taxonomy":"areas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/areas?post=34265"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
