He is generally interested in the development of agent-based modelling techniques and the use of analytical tools from statistical physics for the purpose of understanding the economy as a complex system, with a focus on policy assessment.<\/p>\n<p>Adri\u00e1n\u2019s current work focuses on the development of spatially-distributed agent-based models to study the economic impact of infrastructure investments. In particular, his models try to capture the mechanisms by which transport infrastructure has an impact on the dynamics of housing markets and, as a consequence, on the spatial distribution of housing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>University of Oxford<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":38583,"template":"","categories":[64],"areas":[45],"class_list":["post-34245","person","type-person","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-researchers","areas-transport"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/person\/34245","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/person"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/person"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/38583"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34245"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34245"},{"taxonomy":"areas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/areas?post=34245"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
