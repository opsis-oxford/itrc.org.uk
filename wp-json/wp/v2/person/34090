Prof Hall is internationally recognised for his research on risk analysis and decision making under uncertainty for water resource systems, flood and coastal risk management, infrastructure systems and adaptation to climate change. Professor Hall is a member of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/organisations\/council-for-science-and-technology\">Prime Minister&#8217;s Council for Science and Technology<\/a>\u00a0and is Expert Advisor to the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nic.org.uk\/\">National Infrastructure Commission<\/a>. He is Chair of the Science Advisory Committee of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iiasa.ac.at\/\">International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)<\/a>. He was a member of the UK independent\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theccc.org.uk\/\">Committee on Climate Change Adaptation<\/a>\u00a0from 2009 to 2019.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article-header\">Prof Hall&#8217;s group in the University of Oxford is at the forefront of risk analysis of climatic extremes and their impacts on infrastructure networks and economic systems, from local to global scales. He led the development of the National Infrastructure Systems Model (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/nismod\/\">NISMOD<\/a>), which was used for the UK&#8217;s first National Infrastructure Assessment and for analysis of the resilience of energy, transport, digital and water networks in Great Britain. His group developed the first national water resource systems simulation model for England and Wales. Prof Hall conceived of, and now chairs, the UK&#8217;s Data and Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dafni.ac.uk\/\">DAFNI<\/a>). His systems analysis methods have been applied worldwide, including in Argentina, China, Curacao, St Lucia, Tanzania and Vietnam. He has published four books, including,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/books\/future-of-national-infrastructure\/7D4DF0295A9D8A7304E6C87204BAA0EA\">The Future of National Infrastructure: A System-of-Systems Approach<\/a>, which was published by Cambridge University Press in 2016.<\/p>\n<p class=\"article-header\">Amongst various distinctions, Prof Hall was awarded the George Stephenson Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers in 2001 and the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water in 2018. Prof Hall was a Contributing Author to the Nobel Prize-winning Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 2010 Prof Hall was elected as a Fellow of the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.raeng.org.uk\/\">Royal Academy of Engineering<\/a>\u00a0&#8220;for his contribution to the development of methods for flood risk analysis, which underpin approaches for flood risk management in the UK and internationally&#8221;. He has published more than 160 articles in peer reviewed journals, which have been cited more than 15,000 times, and is editor of the journal\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/19447973\">Water Resources Research<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>University of Oxford, Director of the ITRC<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":34140,"template":"","categories":[57,62],"areas":[39,58,41,44,50,45,47,49],"class_list":["post-34090","person","type-person","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-featured","category-principal-investigator","areas-digital","areas-economics","areas-energy","areas-population","areas-risk-and-resilience","areas-transport","areas-urban-development","areas-water"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/person\/34090","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/person"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/person"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/34140"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=34090"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=34090"},{"taxonomy":"areas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/areas?post=34090"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
