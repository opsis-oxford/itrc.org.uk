We have also carried out a pilot investment analysis into the capacity and coverage required to roll-out 5G in the Netherlands.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #006f74;\"><strong>Pioneering 5G infrastructure investment model for the UK and beyond<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>To develop the model, the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium and the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dafni.ac.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data &amp; Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>(DAFNI) paired up to create an open-source software tool for both mobile and fixed networks. It enables users to assess the required costs for rolling out different levels of 5G coverage and can be applied in the UK and overseas.<\/p>\n<p>The model uses data from a range of sources, including population forecasts, system capacities, coverage and data demands, and budget constraints, to examine what different strategies for implementation could look like. The outcomes can be used to inform government decision-making, as well as for businesses planning for the future.<\/p>\n<p>Currently it\u2019s very difficult to quantify the performance of different digital infrastructure strategies for either 5G or rolling out fibre-to-the-premises.<\/p>\n<p>The platform we are testing allows different strategies to be compared in terms of capacity, coverage and cost, allowing industry and government to take better-informed decisions. Uniquely, this model has a graphical user interface which means it can be used by non-technical users, unlike the limited number of engineering models that exist.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #006f74;\"><strong>Wider availability of the model<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The model is currently being piloted, and we plan to make it available for alpha testing in summer 2019.<\/p>\n<p>It will be particularly useful for start-ups and other smaller providers and technology companies in the 5G sector, plus government departments who require quantified intelligence in order to make business and policy decisions.<\/p>\n<p>For example, quantifying the costs of deploying and accessing 5G services can help smaller companies understand how best to develop their own business model, including how they optimise the delivery of their own products and services to different places.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #006f74;\"><strong>Investment decisions for telecoms players<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>Many players in the telecommunications industry in the UK and worldwide have been experiencing flat or declining revenues due to a variety of factors, particularly the proliferation of free-to-use communication tools such as WhatsApp.<\/p>\n<p>Decisions over investments need to be carefully considered as the industry starts to sink billions into 5G technology for use cases which include Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Massive Machine-type Communications (mMTC) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #006f74;\"><strong>Investment decisions for government and local authorities<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The importance of making appropriate and future-proofed investments in infrastructure were boosted by the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/752185\/CX_letter_resillience_study_and_terms_or_reference_29102018__002__final-digi.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chancellor\u2019s request<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>in autumn to the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nic.org.uk\/news\/new-resilience-study-to-examine-how-infrastructure-can-withstand-future-challenges\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Infrastructure Commission<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>(NIC) to conduct a study on infrastructure resilience.
