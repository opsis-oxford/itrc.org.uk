The FTA begins with a broad understanding of the issues particular to Palestine, moving to a focus on how infrastructure systems are currently being used, and then considers what constrains the capacity of each infrastructure sector. ITRC\u2019s researchers also assess the drivers of future demand for infrastructure services, and identify recent trends and future plans for infrastructure provision.<\/p>\n<p>A range of strategic options for infrastructure provision are then applied to the Palestinian context.

However, despite high waste collection rates in urban environments, the opportunities to make full use of this resource are limited by illegal dumping and a lack of well-managed waste facilities.<\/p>\n<p>Transport infrastructure is all road-based and mobility is restricted by security measures which affect not only internal mobility and trade within Palestine, but also access to external markets.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-size: large; color: #006f74;\"><strong>The challenge ahead<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>A number of major infrastructure projects are underway or being planned to deliver improved infrastructure services to the people of Palestine. Such measures have prioritised water and energy, with emphasis appropriately given to the acute crisis in the Gaza Strip, and the government of Israel recently announced increases in supplies of water and electricity to Palestine.<\/p>\n<p>However, with current socio-economic trends and the spectre of climate change these measures will still fail to meet the most basic needs in the near future, even under an optimistic scenario of high economic growth, high investment in new infrastructure, and no natural or man-made disasters.<\/p>\n<p>The tight coupling of many of Palestine\u2019s infrastructure systems, particularly energy and water, and energy and transport, require solutions that work with such interdependencies. Given the multitude of government, private and donor community actors involved in infrastructure decisions, it is clear that the Palestinian Authority faces a complex and challenging task ahead. The FTA and the process of capacity building through the application of NISMOD-Int to the Palestinian context are designed to enhance the Palestine Authority\u2019s capacity to meet such challenges.<\/p>\n<p>Work will be needed to develop indicators capable of tracking the performance of alternative strategies and tying these indicators to the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals. Developing such capabilities will enable system-wide evidence-based infrastructure planning to coordinate, prioritise and monitor future delivery of infrastructure services. It will also provide confidence in the institutional capacity and consistency in decision-making necessary to attract further donor funding and much needed private investment into infrastructure and the economy.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_blurb use_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; font_icon=&#8221;%%165%%&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;#006f74&#8243; use_circle=&#8221;on&#8221; circle_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; icon_placement=&#8221;left&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#006f74&#8243; background_layout=&#8221;dark&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;30px|30px|30px|30px|true|true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b>Institutions:<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and University of Oxford-led Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC)<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_blurb][et_pb_blurb use_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; font_icon=&#8221;%%71%%&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; use_circle=&#8221;on&#8221; icon_placement=&#8221;left&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#3c3c3c&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;dark&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;30px|30px|30px|30px|true|true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p>Further reading:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-content\/PDFs\/PalestineFTA_online.pdf\">A Fast Track Analysis of infrastructure provision in Palestine \u2013 Outcomes from the ITRC\/UNOPS collaboration<\/a> (pdf, 6.9 MB)<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_blurb][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.22&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|||&#8221;][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;2_3,1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|||&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;2_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;3.27.4&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221;] The Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC) is working with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) to help the people of Palestine to more easily plan the development of their communities and economy.
