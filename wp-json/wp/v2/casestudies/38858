Further, investment in unsustainable infrastructure can bequeath future generations with debt whilst failing to meet the most basic infrastructure essentials such as water, sanitation and energy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Scott Thacker of UNOPS adds, \u201cWith $2.3 trillion being spent per year on global capital infrastructure investment, funding is at an all time high. However, in some areas of the world there is still a lack of the most basic infrastructure, infrastructure that\u2019s designed to satisfy future population growth, or to protect society from the harmful impacts of climate change.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"color: #006f74;\"><strong>Sustainable infrastructure positively impacts patterns of behaviour and development<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>The paper focuses on the interplay between the physical and societal aspects of infrastructure systems, such as how long-lived assets shape future patterns of behaviour and development.<\/p>\n<p>It classifies direct and indirect influences of infrastructure services on SDG goals and target outcomes.
