This type of disruption can be caused by man-made actions (on purpose or as a result of error) or by natural events such as flooding, extreme heat or high winds, with extreme weather situations set to become more likely with climate change and global warming.<\/p>\n<p>Ensuring that monies spent on infrastructure are spent in the right place, in the most efficient way, in ways that will ensure projects complement each other now and in the long term, and can withstand incidents, have been boosted by the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/752185\/CX_letter_resillience_study_and_terms_or_reference_29102018__002__final-digi.pdf\">Chancellor\u2019s request<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>to the<span>\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nic.org.uk\/news\/new-resilience-study-to-examine-how-infrastructure-can-withstand-future-challenges\/\">National Infrastructure Commission<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/highlights\/dafni-data-and-analytics-facility-for-national-infrastructure\/imperative-for-resilient-uk-infrastructure-fuelled-by-chancellors-pledge\/#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>(NIC) to conduct a study on infrastructure resilience.<\/p>\n<p>Infrastructure underpins success: the UK\u2019s economic success is dependent on having efficient and reliable infrastructure systems.
