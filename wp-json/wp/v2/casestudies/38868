The Arc has been proposed as a knowledge-intensive economic cluster spanning the heart of England. New high value businesses will be supported by new transport infrastructure and housing development.<\/p>\n<p>It is now more than two years since the National Infrastructure Commission\u2019s report on the Arc. Many initiatives are under way involving central and local government, businesses and the universities in the Arc. However, a clear vision for the Arc that integrates infrastructure (both grey and green), employment and housing has yet to emerge.<\/p>\n<p>The Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC) is a consortium of seven leading UK universities, including the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, which has for the last eight years been developing models and analytical methods for the planning of national infrastructure systems: energy, transport, digital communications and water.<\/p>\n<p>The ITRC has developed methods for simulating future population, housing growth and demand for infrastructure services, and exploring how the necessary infrastructure can be provided affordably, securely and sustainably. The Consortium is independently applying its models and analytics to explore possible futures for the Arc. \u00a0In order to better understand the issues at stake, it has held in-depth discussions with 22 prominent stakeholder organisations leading the development of the Arc \u00a0in central, regional and local government, as well as universities, independent agencies and businesses, \u00a0to answer questions including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where could future housing development be located in the Arc?<\/li>\n<li>Can enough water be supplied for an increased number of inhabitants?<\/li>\n<li>Can the housing and infrastructure in the Arc be made carbon neutral?<\/li>\n<li>How can cherished natural habitats be preserved?<\/li>\n<li>What are the differences between the outcomes of large scale unplanned development and the outcomes of sustainably planned development that creates strategic networks of green and blue infrastructure to meet local needs? What does the future look like?<\/li>\n<li>How much will it cost to provide an Arc that is connected with 5G communications and fibre to every home?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Having been working throughout 2019 on these questions, we presented preliminary results for discussion and consultation. We welcome feedback on how the work can be taken forwards to inform the many stakeholders in the Arc.<\/p>\n<p>There are several contrasting versions for how the Arc could be delivered, which the ITRC has been using as the basis for its scenario analysis. We have studied many of the recent housing developments in the local authorities within the Arc: is scaling up this form of development feasible and sustainable, or are radically new types of development needed? If so, what market and regulator instruments are needed to deliver a new vision for the Arc?<\/p>\n<p>We aim to demonstrate the capabilities of the UK\u2019s universities (inside and outside the Arc) to add value and insight to this complex and contested initiative.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_blurb use_icon=&#8221;on&#8221; font_icon=&#8221;%%71%%&#8221; icon_color=&#8221;#ffffff&#8221; use_circle=&#8221;on&#8221; icon_placement=&#8221;left&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#3c3c3c&#8221; background_layout=&#8221;dark&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;30px|30px|30px|30px|true|true&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/arc-report-2019-V4.pdf\"><strong>View the Executive Summary of the ITRC-MISTRAL report on the analysis of the OxCam Arc<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/3271-2\/\"><\/a><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/itrc-transport-modelling-for-the-oxcam-arc\/\" style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Learn more about the ITRC transport model for the OxCam Arc<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/energy-options-for-the-oxford-cambridge-arc\/\">Learn more about Energy options for the Oxford-Cambridge Arc<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/?p=3413&amp;preview=true\">Learn more about the ITRC analysis of 5G demand in the Oxcam Arc<\/a><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_blurb][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;section&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;3.22&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|||&#8221;][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;2_3,1_3&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;row&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|||&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;2_3&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;3.25&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text admin_label=&#8221;Text&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.2.2&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px|||||&#8221;] Evaluating impact of local, regional and national choices on sustainable future options ITRC launched a report on the use of infrastructure systems analysis to inform planning and design of the Oxford-Milton Keynes-Cambridge [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":33692,"template":"","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":""},"categories":[135,89],"areas":[66],"class_list":["post-38868","casestudies","type-casestudies","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-event","category-highlights","areas-infrastructure-systems"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/casestudies\/38868","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/casestudies"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/casestudies"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/33692"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=38868"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=38868"},{"taxonomy":"areas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/areas?post=38868"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
