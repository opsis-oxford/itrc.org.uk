The model uses expectations around growth of future demand, build information. It is a statistical engineering model looking at how and where to deploy new assets. Strategies modelled include not investing, using brownfield or greenfield sites or a mix, the results could help make decisions around where small cells should be deployed, whether to use street furniture as part of the digital communications strategy.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Digital-Communications-1.pdf\">Please check the presentation slides here<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ITRC-MISTRAL Infrastructure Analysis: Oxcam Arc \u2013 Internet connectivity, Dr  Ed Oughton\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/H45mawujdBU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ed looked at how internet connectivity is now essential to participate in society and proposed an evidence-based model to make decisions around deployment of digital communications strategy.
