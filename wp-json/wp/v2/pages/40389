The team also sought to model whether planned road expansions and developments would be sufficient to prevent travel time increases in long run, and energy requirements around uptake of electric vehicles.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Transport-connectivity-1-1.pdf\">Please check the presentation slides here<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ITRC-MISTRAL Infrastructure Analysis: Oxcam Arc \u2013 Transport connectivity, Simon Blainey\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/yK8dTxyjG_I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Simon presented the transport group\u2019s work and the three main models covering railway, airport and road.
