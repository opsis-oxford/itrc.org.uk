Through extensive data collection and cross-sectoral analyses, it estimates Curacao\u2019s future infrastructure needs for energy, water, solid waste and wastewater services and delivers recommendations for how those needs can be met. Additionally, climate change driven flood risks to roads, social infrastructures and development projects are assessed for the purpose of prioritising risk reduction activities. In doing so, it provides new and important evidence to support infrastructure decision-making to ensure long-term sustainable and resilient development.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This report establishes the first milestone in a partnership between the Government of Curacao, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and the University of Oxford-led Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC).
