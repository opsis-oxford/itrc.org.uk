Reducing fossil-fuel dependency and CO2 emissions from the energy sector requires a big shift in the ways in which electricity is generated, to incorporate much larger contributions from nuclear and renewable energy. This transition will have to be synchronised with modifications to the transmission network to enable efficient use of varied and variable supply technologies and patterns of demand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Infrastructure systems \u2013 including those that manage transportation, telecommunications, energy, water and waste management \u2013 have come into being in advanced economies in the centuries since industrialisation.
