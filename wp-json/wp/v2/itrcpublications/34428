Of importance is the ability to measure, and subsequently plan, for how resilient these interdependent systems are to multiple economic disruptions. We have addressed such issues in this study by developing dynamic economic resilience estimation metrics from a dynamic economic risk estimation model. The ultimate goal of this study is to introduce an adaptive dynamic resilience estimation planning framework. We have developed a 4-tuple resilience metric to capture system average level of functionality, maximum loss of functionality, time to recovery and rate of recovery, all of which provide a complete resilience measurement for adaptive dynamic resilience. An example problem shows the usefulness of the resilience metrics in recovery planning.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The interdependent nature of today\u2019s infrastructure and industry sectors intensifies in light of major disruptive events, as inoperability propagates throughout physical, geographical and economic dimensions.
