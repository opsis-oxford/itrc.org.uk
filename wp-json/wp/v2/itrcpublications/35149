This research looks at the fundamental issues of understanding the vulnerability and risks to Chinese infrastructures due to adverse climate impacts. The authors have developed a suite of infrastructure (energy, transport, water, waste and ICT) models to understand how exposed China\u2019s infrastructure is to various potential climate change impacts. A concept called the \u201cinfrastructure criticality hotspot\u201d is used which is defined as a geographical location where there is a concentration of critical infrastructure, measured according to the number of customers directly or indirectly dependent upon it. Key findings from this research show that China\u2019s top infrastructure vulnerability hotspots are Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Shanghai and Zhejiang. Using spatial hydrological models, the authors then investigate how these areas may be affected by flooding. The research shows that railways, aviation, shipping, electricity, and waste water in Anhui, Beijing, Guangdong, Hebei, Henan, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanghai, Tianjin, Zhejiang \u2014and their 66 cities \u2014are exceptionally exposed. The average number of people who use these services and could be disrupted by the impacts of flooding stands at 103 million.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Extreme weather events in China, expected to become increasingly common because of climate change, pose a grave threat to essential infrastructure that provides running water, electricity, road and railway connections.
