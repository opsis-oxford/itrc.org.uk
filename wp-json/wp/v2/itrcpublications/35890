To meet this demand the ITRC-Mistral development team has collaborated with the Science and Technology Facility to make use of their computing facility at Harwell called the Data and Analytics Facility for National Infrastructure (DAFNI).<\/p>\n<p>The team developed functionality to enable NISMOD to farm out multiple model runs on the DAFNI computing cluster.
