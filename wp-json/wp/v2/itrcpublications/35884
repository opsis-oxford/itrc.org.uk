But they are not an unaffordable wish list. They have been costed in line with the government\u2019s guideline for investment in infrastructure. And they are affordable for households and businesses.<\/p>\n<p>The Commission was set up to address the lack of a long term infrastructure strategy, siloed decision making in infrastructure sectors, fragile political consensus and short termism. The Commission has addressed these issues by taking a long term, cross-sectoral approach, with in-depth analysis and wide consultation.<\/p>\n<p>The government has committed to respond to the Commission\u2019s recommendations and to adopt agreed recommendations as government policy.<\/p>\n<p>The recommendations set out a pathway for the UK\u2019s economic infrastructure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>nationwide full fibre broadband by 2033<\/li>\n<li>half of the UK\u2019s power provided by renewables by 2030<\/li>\n<li>three quarters of plastic packaging recycled by 2030<\/li>\n<li>\u00a343 billion of stable long term transport funding for regional cities<\/li>\n<li>preparing for 100 per cent electric vehicle sales by 2030<\/li>\n<li>ensuring resilience to extreme drought<\/li>\n<li>a national standard of flood resilience for all communities by 2050.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Alongside these, better design and more efficient funding and financing can save money, reduce risk, add value and create a legacy that looks good and works well.<\/p>\n<p>These recommendations will equip the UK with the infrastructure it most needs. The Commission will continue to work to build consensus. It will hold government to account for the implementation of its recommendations. And it will continue to work on the nation\u2019s most pressing infrastructure issues.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The first National Infrastructure Assessment sets out the Commission\u2019s plan of action for the country\u2019s infrastructure over the next 10-30 years.
