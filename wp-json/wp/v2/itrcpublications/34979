Experience has shown, however, that comprehensive records of storm drain inlet locations are often missing or incomplete, preventing users accessing the full benefit of these modelling capabilities. Therefore, this study developed a GIS routine to generate synthetic storm drain inlet locations for the purpose of urban flood modelling. Hydrodynamic model results for a synthetically generated and surveyed storm drain inlet network were obtained using the CityCAT 1D\/2D system. On a catchment scale the flow field (surface and flow captured by inlets) simulated by the network of synthetic storm drainage inlets shows satisfactory results when compared with that simulated using the actual network. The results also highlight the sensitivity of the inflows to relatively small changes in terms of the location of storm drain inlets and the effectiveness of storm drain inlets in ponding areas.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recent developments in urban drainage modelling allow for a more realistic coupling of the two-dimensional (2D) surface and one-dimensional (1D) sub-surface drainage domain exchanging water through storm drain inlets instead of a sub-catchment approach based on manholes.
