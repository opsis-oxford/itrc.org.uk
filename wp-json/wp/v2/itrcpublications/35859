This included: testing ambitious user speed targets at 30, 100 and 300 Mbps, comparing the infrastructure cost implications for mobile-only versus fixed\/mobile network operators; and applying a high-resolution capacity-demand assessment model.<\/p>\n<p>By running multiple scenarios, decision-makers are able to check what happens to capacity, coverage, and cost when parameters are adjusted. It encourages them to consider a range of options, whether they are sticking to the mainstream, or instead choosing something more ambitious.<\/p>\n<p>Within the telecommunications sector, this analysis would normally be conducted internally.\u00a0 By using ITRC-MISTRAL\u2019s methodology, this study is bringing transparency to the process of technological innovation.<\/p>\n<p>The report is due to be launched by mid-2018.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In autumn 2017, ITRC-MISTRAL digital specialists, Dr Ed Oughton and Dr Zoraida Frias embarked on a project to support the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs in assessing the potential costs of 5G mobile telecommunications infrastructure.
