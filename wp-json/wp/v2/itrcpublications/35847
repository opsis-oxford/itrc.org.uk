Where integral populations are preferred, the package also provides two variants of a quasirandom sampling algorithm (QIS) which generate high entropy \u2018IPF-like\u2019 whole-number populations. The first variant is extremely fast but can only be used where no seed data is provided, and is described in (Smith, Lovelace, and Birkin 2017). The second variant (QIS-I) supports a seed population by sampling from a dynamically-computed IPF population.<\/p>\n<p>The QIS-I algorithm can also be used to integerise precomputed multidimensional fractional populations. Functions are also provided to integerise discrete univariate probability distributions, directly generate quasirandom (Sobol) sequences, and to convert populations represented as counts in a multidimensional state array to a tabular form listing individuals.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>humanleague is a microsynthesis package for R and python, with its core implementation in C++.
