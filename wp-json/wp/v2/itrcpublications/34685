Whilst Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are critical to maintaining acceptable levels of functionality, they do not provide insights over the longer timescales across which strategic investment decisions play out. To understand how individual or multiple, interdependent, infrastructure sectors perform over longer timescales, capacity\/demand modelling is required. However, the outputs of such models are often a complex high-dimensionality result-set, and this complexity is further compounded when cross-sector evaluation is required. To maximise utility of such models, tools are required that can process and present key outputs. In this paper we describe the development of prototype tools for infrastructure performance evaluation in relation to different strategic decisions and the complex outputs generated from capacity and demand models of five infrastructure sectors (energy, water, waste water, solid waste, transport) investigated within the UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC). By constructing tools that expose various dimensions of the model outputs, a user is able to take greater control over the knowledge discovery process.<\/p>\n<p>The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP\/I01344X\/1 to the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC), and the respective authors\u2019 host institutions of Newcastle University, University of Oxford and Southampton University.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Across different infrastructure sectors there are systems that help to monitor the current and near-future operation and performance of a particular system.
