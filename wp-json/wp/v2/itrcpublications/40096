Risk-based decision-making and simulation models are increasingly being used to guide water resource management in England. We argue that these approaches and tools are sufficient to analyse persistence and adaptability, provided they incorporate systems\u2019 coping and recovery during and after extreme events, along with a broad framing of human, economic and environmental impacts. On the other hand, we find that transformability is not readily incorporated into risk-based decision-making and related simulation tools, as it relies, amongst other things, on the capacity of institutions to identify and implement change. In England, risk-based concepts and simulation tools provide evidence with which to quantify water supply system persistence during shocks and adaptability on a range of timescales. An historical analysis reveals the adaptability of England\u2019s water supply system in response to changing economic needs for water and societal expectations for water security, as well as external drivers including conservation of the aquatic environment and the politics of privatisation of water utilities. The frequency and impact of harmful drought events suggests a low degree of persistence. We find a potential for transformability through more strategic, national-scale assessment and planning, and setting up resilience targets that are consistent across the country. However, we also show that the system has not initiated such (potentially) transformational changes until very recently. <a class=\"text-truncator__toggle mod-clickable less\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Hide truncated text\" data-selenium-selector=\"text-truncator-toggle\">LESS<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"flex-container flex-wrap flex-paper-actions-group alternate-sources\">\n<div class=\"flex-item\">\n<div class=\"flex-container flex-paper-actions small-links\">\n<div class=\"flex-item primary-paper-link-button\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We explore the triumvirate of resilience \u2013 \u2018persistence\u2019, \u2018adaptability\u2019 and \u2018transformability\u2019 \u2013 in the context of England\u2019s water supply infrastructure system.
