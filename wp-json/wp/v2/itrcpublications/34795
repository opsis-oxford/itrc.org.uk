While appealing in principle, developing a national infrastructure strategy in practice poses major challenges of complexity and uncertainty. The UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium has set out a systematic methodology for long-term analysis of the performance of national infrastructure systems. It deals with each infrastructure sector \u2013 energy, transport, digital communications, water supply, waste water, flood protection and solid waste \u2013 in a consistent framework and assesses the interdependencies between sectors. The method is supported with the world\u2019s first infrastructure \u2018system-of-systems\u2019 model, which has been developed for long-term decision analysis in interdependent infrastructure systems. This paper presents the Nismod model\u2019s analysis in the National Needs Assessment report launched at the Institution of Civil Engineers in October 2016.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There have been many calls for a more strategic, long-term approach to national infrastructure in the UK and elsewhere around the world.
