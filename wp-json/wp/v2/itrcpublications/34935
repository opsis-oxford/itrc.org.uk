They found that spectrum strategies required the least amount of capital expenditure and were capable of meeting baseline demand until approximately 2025, after which more spectrum capacity would be required. Alternatively, small cell deployments provided significant capacity but at considerable cost, and hence are likely only in the densest locations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This working paper from the Cambridge Judge Business School, and written by ITRC-MISTRAL researchers, uses scenarios to test how different business strategies might perform over the long-term, with a focus on capacity expansion via 5G mobile telecommunications infrastructure.
