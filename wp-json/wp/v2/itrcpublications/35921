This is regarded as one of the first cyber\u2010physical attacks on electricity infrastructure to have led to a substantial power outage and is illustrative of the increasing vulnerability of Critical National Infrastructure to this type of malicious activity. Few data points, coupled with the rapid emergence of cyber phenomena, has held back the development of resilience analytics of cyber\u2010physical attacks, relative to many other threats. We propose to overcome data limitations by applying stochastic counterfactual risk analysis as part of a new vulnerability assessment framework. The method is developed in the context of the direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of a Ukrainian\u2010style cyber\u2010physical attack taking place on the electricity distribution network serving London and its surrounding regions. A key finding is that if decision\u2010makers wish to mitigate major population disruptions, then they must invest resources more\u2010or\u2010less equally across all substations, to prevent the scaling of a cyber\u2010physical attack. However, there are some substations associated with higher economic value due to their support of other Critical National Infrastructures assets, which justifies the allocation of additional cyber security investment to reduce the chance of cascading failure. Further cyber\u2010physical vulnerability research must address the tradeoffs inherent in a system made up of multiple institutions with different strategic risk mitigation objectives and metrics of value, such as governments, infrastructure operators, and commercial consumers of infrastructure services.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In December 2015, a cyber\u2010physical attack took place on the Ukrainian electricity distribution network.
