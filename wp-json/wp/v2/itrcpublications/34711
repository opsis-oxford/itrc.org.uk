Significant failures such as power blackouts and their subsequent knock-on effects on other infrastructures are particularly important to understand. We present a spatially explicit method for representing infrastructure spatial dependencies and modelling of failure impacts using a PotsgreSQL-PostGIS database coupled with spatial network failure models. The utility of the methodology is shown by simulating how the London underground may respond to different failure types on the South East electricity transmission grid.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The resilience of infrastructure networks to different types of perturbation is of significant interest due to the importance of these systems for the efficient functioning of modern society.
