In order to overcome the limits of\u00a0<em class=\"a-plus-plus\">\u03bb<\/em>\u00a0<sub class=\"a-plus-plus\">U<\/sub>\u00a0analysis, we test several alternative tools such as a pool of formal statistical tests devised for recognizing upper tail independence and graphical diagnostics based on binary correlation and binary entropy. The reliability of all the methods is preliminarily checked by Monte Carlo experiments. Statistical tests and graphical diagnostics are therefore applied to three different rainfall data sets that allow us to explore the properties of the spatial dependence structure of rainfall extremes over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales ranging from 30\u00a0min and 1\u00a0km to 30 days and\u00a0<span class=\"a-plus-plus inline-equation id-i-eq4\"><span class=\"a-plus-plus equation-source format-t-e-x\"><span id=\"MathJax-Element-1-Frame\" class=\"MathJax\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-1\" class=\"math\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-2\" class=\"mrow\"><span id=\"MathJax-Span-3\" class=\"mo\">\u2248<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span>\u00a0<\/span>3000\u00a0km. Results highlight that (1) classical estimators provide non zero tail dependence even for cases where it should be zero; (2) formal tests and binary correlation highlight that the pairwise spatial dependence structure can be weaker than Gaussian, thus excluding UTD calculated in a pairwise manner; (3) the binary entropy computed on triples of locations shows that the pairwise UTD is not enough to explain the spatial dependence structure of extreme rainfall, whose complexity becomes evident only after resorting to higher order correlation measures. The results concerning the bias and uncertainty of\u00a0<em class=\"a-plus-plus\">\u03bb<\/em>\u00a0<sub class=\"a-plus-plus\">U<\/sub>\u00a0estimators are fully general and suggest avoiding their use especially for the short time series usually available in hydrology.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The simultaneous occurrence of extreme events, such as simultaneous storms and floods at different locations, has a serious impact on risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
