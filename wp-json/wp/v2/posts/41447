Their work has been widely taken up \u2013 ITRC has conducted research on behalf of governments worldwide, and for the UK\u2019s National Resilience Review, the Department of Transport, the Environmental Agency\u2019s Long-term Investment Strategy and the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC)\u2019s recent Infrastructure Resilience Study.<\/p>\n<p>Using UK and worldwide case-study examples, Raghav gave a presentation which illustrated how the ITRC identifies infrastructure network vulnerabilities and risks using process-based network models; what the direct and indirect economic impacts on infrastructure can be \u2013 here ITRC has identified some unexpected, long-term, cascading effects from single-asset failures, such as power \u2013 what resilience interventions or policies could be used to reduce the vulnerability of critical assets and how we can prioritise resilience in investment to reduce systematic risks.<\/p>\n<p>Edward spoke about his widely-published and pioneering work for ITRC on more extreme events \u2013such as cyber-risks on electricity distribution infrastructure networks, assessments on space weather risks to UK and US infrastructure and work for the Canadian Space Agency.<\/p>\n<p>Keynote speaker Mike Steel, who is responsible for the Environmental Agency\u2019s Long-term Investment Scenario \u2013 an economic analysis that investigates the planning, cost and benefits in investing in flood and coastal defences \u2013 emphasised how the agency\u2019s long-term collaboration with the ITRC on potential impacts of flooding on infrastructure systems informed and validated much of their decision-making and helped strengthen their case for investment.<\/p>\n<p>Carlos S\u00e1nchez from the Coalition for Climate Resilient Investment (CCRI) brought an international and finance-sector perspective to the discussion. The CCRI is an initiative that brings together the global private finance industry with a commitment to advance practical solutions that guide investment decision-making with regard to climate risk. He spoke of how the application and value of ITRC\u2019s work on this subject holds multi-billion dollar, worldwide interest.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the discussion, questions poured in from \u2018Chat\u2019, widening the scope of the webinar \u2013 questions about the validity\/availability\/security of data; on stakeholder engagement; infrastructure asset condition and how that can be factored into modelling; electromagnetic pulses; how nature-based solutions might form part of flood management and how to model and validate the more extreme, unpredictable climate changes we\u2019re increasingly experiencing.<\/p>\n<p>Watch the webinar on catch up, below:<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"ITRC Webinar 5 - Resilient Infrastructure\" width=\"1080\" height=\"608\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Hl_PnZ5touM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Showcasing ITRC\u2019s impressive and ground-breaking work on risk and resilience in infrastructure modelling On 28 October 2020, ITRC Director Jim Hall presented the fifth webinar in ITRC\u2019s series \u2013 demonstrating ITRC\u2019s system of systems approach to understanding the potential scale of threats to infrastructure from climate-related, security-related and space weather hazards, and to identify and [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":18,"featured_media":37334,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"","_et_pb_old_content":"","_et_gb_content_width":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[89],"tags":[],"areas":[],"class_list":["post-41447","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-highlights"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/41447","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/18"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=41447"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/41447\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":41449,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/41447\/revisions\/41449"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/37334"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=41447"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=41447"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=41447"},{"taxonomy":"areas","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.itrc.org.uk\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/areas?post=41447"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
